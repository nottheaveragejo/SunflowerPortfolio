		<p> Full stack developer and writer determined to marry the two great passions of my life.
		 I look forward to collaborating with brilliant, outstanding individuals to create projects 
		 I can be proud of, continue to enhance my skill, and make meaningful contributions.

		It during the spring semester of my senior year of college that I decided I would not
		allow myself to be crippled in fear. Naturally, I pulled out of my acceptance to pharmacy
		school in an attempt to manifest fullfillment. The product of this was a novel, one of six in a multi generational
		high fantasy opera with 10,000 years of lore. A girl trying to meet her destiny. A boy
		with no direction, bearing the brunt of a legacy to uphold. Fantastic battles. Foldable cities.
		It was from this that I sought critique for my book, yet there were few sources willing operaable to
		do so. So I decided to make my own writing platform. From there, I fell in love 
		with the power of creating sleek websites, the fullfillment of solving puzzles and 
		decoding the riddles of algorithms. After some initial hesitance, I took the leap,
		pushed my fears deep down, and was fortunate enough to be accepted into Grace Hopper in order to 
		further my dreams.

		When I'm not biking in the Japanese wilderness, the Amstel river, or to South Street Seaport,
		you can find me eating ice cream, going to art galleries,
		 and listening to bluesy jazz in the West Village.
